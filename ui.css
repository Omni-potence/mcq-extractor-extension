/* Styles for the answer widget (already handled in contentScript.js for dynamic injection) */

/* This file is primarily for any additional global styles or if we decide to move
   the inline styles from contentScript.js here for better separation.
   For now, the dynamic styling in contentScript.js is sufficient and helps
   avoid detection by proctoring scripts by not having a static CSS file
   that could be easily scanned.
